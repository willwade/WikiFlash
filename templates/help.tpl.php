    <li><b>&quot;Why should I share my information to the world?! Its taken me a long time to learn this!&quot; and other questions that relate to why?</b> Please see the <a href="/action/wikipedia">FAQ's on the Wikipedia page of this site</a> for more of these type of questions.</li>
    <li><strong>&quot;Do I create a new page or should I add to the Occupational_Therapy page?&quot; </strong>In short, if your not sure always add to the Occupational_Therapy page. If it gets too big we can seperate it out at a later date. See 3. below for a further explanation of this.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>&quot;I have created a new page for my topic and someone has placed something on it saying 'it will be deleted in 5 days'!! Arrgh! Whats going on?&quot;</b>Its a tricky decision to decide whether your piece should fit into the main body of &quot;Occupational_Therapy&quot; or should sit outside of that. None of the organising members are administrators on wikipedia so we can't magically remove this rather scary warning. The best thing to do is follow the advice given in the banner - at the very least simply merge it with &quot;Occupational_Therapy&quot; and if the section becomes rather large then we can take it back out of the main stub. We do sympathise though - just hold in on there - your efforts are certainly not wasted!</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Who is funding this?&quot; </strong>It is being done as an entriely voluntary project. No funding has been provided for this project. &nbsp;</li>
